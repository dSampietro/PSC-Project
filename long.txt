Technology has always been a powerful force in shaping human civilization, from the invention of the wheel and the plow to the steam engine and the internet. 
In the 21st century, the pace of technological change has accelerated dramatically, touching virtually every aspect of human life. 
From communication and transportation to healthcare and education, technology now plays a central role in shaping the structures, experiences, and values of modern society.
One of the most evident impacts of technology is in the realm of communication. The advent of the internet, mobile phones, and social media platforms has fundamentally transformed how people connect with one another. 
Geographic and temporal boundaries that once constrained human interaction have largely been erased. 
Today, a person in Nairobi can conduct a video call with someone in New York in real-time, collaborate on a shared document, or engage in political discussions across borders. 
While this hyper-connectivity has democratized access to information and amplified marginalized voices, it has also introduced new challenges, such as misinformation, cyberbullying, and digital echo chambers that reinforce polarization.
